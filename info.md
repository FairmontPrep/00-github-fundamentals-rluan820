I learned about GitHub that it could help us track changes we make on our projects so we always have a record of what weâ€™ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if needed. It's also a home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world, whether it's visualizing data or building a code for a new game. A part that I still don't really understand now is cloning. How does cloning work? Why does creating a local copy help to fix issues? I think I have to start working on GitHub in order to understand the complex technologies in it.
